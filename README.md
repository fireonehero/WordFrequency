# WordFrequency

WordFrequency is a Python project that takes a text file as input and calculates word frequencies. It provides a visualization of the most frequent words in the form of a bar graph and a word cloud.
Features

* Text preprocessing: Tokenizes the text and removes stopwords using NLTK.
* Word frequency calculation: Determines the frequency of each word in the text using Python's built-in Counter class.
* Visualization: Shows the top N words by frequency in a bar graph and generates a word cloud.

## Getting Started
